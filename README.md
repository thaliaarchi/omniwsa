# omniwsa

An assembler for all dialects of Whitespace assembly.

This is a descriptivist implementation with pedantic bug-for-bug compatibility.
It is considered a bug in omniwsa if its behavior differs from the reference
assemblers. Instead, if upstream is fixed, open an issue here and omniwsa will
be updated to match it.
