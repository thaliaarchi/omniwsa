# Parsing any Whitespace assembly dialect

## Tokens

- Word
- Integer
- Character: `' '`
- String: `" "`
- Colon: `:`
- Semicolon: `;`
- Line comment: `#`, `//`, `--`
- Block comment: `/* */`, `{- -}` (nested)
- Line break: LF, CRLF, CR

```bnf
word        ::= XID_Start XID_Continue*
integer     ::= dec_integer | bin_integer | oct_integer | hex_integer
dec_integer ::= /[-+]?[1-9][0-9_]*|0*/
bin_integer ::= /[-+]?0[bB][01_]*/
oct_integer ::= /[-+]?0[oO]_*[0-7][0-7_]*/
hex_integer ::= /[-+]?0[xX]_*[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F_]*/
colon       ::= ":"
semi        ::= ";"
space       ::= " " | "\t"
comment     ::= â€¦
lf          ::= "\n" | "\r\n" | "\r"
```

Examples:
- `push 1`: word `push`, space, integer `1` => `push 1`
- `3slide`: integer `3`, word `slide` => `slide 3`
- `-1-`: integer `-1`, word `-` => `push -1`, `sub`
- `^2`: word `^`, integer `2` => `copy 2`

Unicode `XID_Start` and `XID_Continue` properties exclude `Pattern_Syntax`,
which may not be appropriate. Other characters probably need to be included.

Note that leading zeros are forbidden for decimal integers. This is because
leading zeros denote leading zeros in the base-2 Whitespace encoding and 10 is
not a power of two, making it ambiguous. It also avoids confusion with C-style
octal literals.

### Integer literals

Whitespace integer literals are encoded in binary with a sign, or as an empty
sequence without a sign. To allow for representing all patterns of literals,
Whitespace assembly distinguishes leading zeros and allows the empty sequence.

Assembly integer literals can be written in decimal (no prefix), binary (with a
`0b` prefix), octal (`0o`), or hexadecimal (`0x`). In decimal, leading zeros are
forbidden, since 10 is not a power of 2, to avoid ambiguity in the number of
leading zeros to use in binary. In binary, octal, and hexadecimal, a `0` after
the prefix indicates that the rest of the integer is encoded in binary, with
each digit padded to a width of 1, 3, or 4 bits, respectively. The empty integer
is represented as the literal `0b`.

### Unresolved

The rules for underscores in integers should be compared to other languages. It
may make sense to forbid trailing or multiple consecutive underscores. Trailing
underscores may be problematic when abutted with a word and, if allowed, may
need to be consumed lazily in the integer grammar, so they are a part of the
word token; however, I cannot think of a case where such a token pair would be
parsed separately instead of joined a single identifier.

Perhaps underscores or another symbol could represent leading zeros in
Whitespace assembly numeric literals. Underscores have no semantic meaning in
other languages, though, so this could be confusing. Only allowing leading zeros
in powers-of-two bases seems to still be a better approach.

    /// - `store (<addr>? <value>)?`
    /// - `retrieve <value>?`
    Space,
    /// - `(add|sub|mul|div|mod) (<lhs>? "," <rhs>)?`
    /// - `store (<addr>? "," <value>)?`
    /// - `retrieve <value>?`
    Comma,
}

enum LabelOrder {
    /// - `(call|jmp|jz|jn) <label>`
    Post,
    /// - `<label> (call|jmp|jz|jn)`
    Pre,
}

### Heuristics

- Almost every program will have `push`; detect push style
  - Postfix: `push n`
  - Literal: `n`
- If `;` appears at the start of a line, it denotes comments
- If multiple instructions are on a line, then disable `;` separators
- Literal pushes are mutually exclusive with optional arguments or `;`
  separators
- First parse the entire `;`-less program, then use those settings to attempt to
  parse with separators
- Forth-style calls without the `call` mnemonic are not allowed

### Parsing semicolon-delimited instructions

Windows (`Vec<usize>`) for non-comment tokens and windows for in semi

## Style

- Consistent mnemonic names
- Consistent mnemonic casing
- Analogous mnemonic naming (e.g. not `printc` and `outnum` together)
- Consistent comment styles
