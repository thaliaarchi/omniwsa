# Burghard Whitespace programs

Whitespace programs written by Oliver Burghard in his Whitespace assembly
dialect. They were originally published on [his site](https://web.archive.org/web/20110911114338/http://www.burghard.info/Code/Whitespace/)
and linked from the official [Whitespace site](https://web.archive.org/web/20150717140342/http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk:80/whitespace/download.php).
They are now maintained on GitHub in repos for [wsa](https://github.com/wspace/burghard-wsa),
[wsinterws](https://github.com/wspace/burghard-wsinterws), and [wsintercpp](https://github.com/wspace/burghard-wsintercpp).

- wsa:
  - examples/prim.wsa
  - libs/io.wsa
  - libs/memory.wsa
- wsinterws:
  - wsinterws.ws
  - wsinterws.wsa

The libs/ and examples/ directories have been collapsed here, because wsa
resolves imports relative to the current directory. wsinterws/wsinterws.ws has
been renamed to wsinterws.origin.ws. All other \*.ws and \*.pws files were
generated with wsa by me.
